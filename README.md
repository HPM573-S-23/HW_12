Economic Evaluation (Weight 2): Perform economic evaluation using cost-utility analysis with discount rate 3%. Assume that: 
-	The utility of being in state “Well” is 1, in state “Stroke” is 0.2, and in state “Post-Stroke” is 0.9. 
-	The annual cost of being in “Post-Stroke” is $200 and when anticoagulation is used, this cost increases to $750. 
-	Stoke results in a one-time cost of $5,000. 
Note: Since the cycle length for this problem will be quite small, we don’t need to perform half-cycle correction.
